Want to help expand Dankiest Dungeonry? How you can help depends on your coding skill.
## I'm a C++ coder!
Great! Here's how you can help:

1. Take a gander at the code and see what you'd like to change.
2. Fork the repository using that nifty button in the top-right.
3. Clone the forked repo to your desktop using GitHub for Windows.
4. Make your changes.
5. Make a pull request.
6. Pray to Octocat that I accept your pull request (I probably will).

Not sure what to code? Look at the issues or get in contact with an existing dev!
## I'm a coder, but I don't know C++.
That's fine. There's lots of great tutorials online. If you'd rather not take the time to learn C++, you can also help in a non-coder fashion.
## I'm a web dev!
Is that so? We could use a great website! Contact me through an issue.
## I'm not a coder :(
Don't be sad! There's still plenty of ways to help with development! For example:
* Learn YAML at yaml.org (don't worry, it's not coding) and make some more levels or enemies using the fork-and-pull method described above.
* Find bugs and report them in the issue tracker.
* Tell your friends about Dankiest Dungeonry!
* Learn C++ (it's not as scary as it looks)

Thanks for playing Dankiest Dungeonry!
